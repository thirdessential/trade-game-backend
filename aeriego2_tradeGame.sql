As you engage the markets, you will discover things about yourself that may be surprising.&nbsp; One of the main keys of successful trading is identifying those tendencies, attitudes, and behaviors undermining your trading objectives. There is usually a gap between how we actually do things and how we think we do them. In order to make any changes, you need to measure this gap and then derive a plan to close it. This process begins with a realistic assessment of where your trading is right now.The least talked about thing in trading is the most important thing in trading and that is Psychology.&nbsp; Even though you may know when you want to enter and when you want to exit doing it under pressure is very difficult.&nbsp; The reason why there so much pressure is because you have to make split decisions, constantly with real money involved.&nbsp; The holy grail or most important skill a trader can possess is trading without emotion.&nbsp; In trading and life, some things work and others don&#39;t. Trading psychology is about taking inventory of both and making adjustments to improve not only your performance, but also to enhance your experience along the way. The primary objective of trading psychology is to help you stick to your plan. It is hard to reach your destination without it. It is said that &lsquo;luck is when opportunity meets preparation&rsquo;. Trading psychology helps the mind prepare to meet both the market&rsquo;s opportunities and its risks.&nbsp; At Relentless trade we focus more on psychology than we do strategy because knowing what to do is one thing and having the discipline to do it is totally different.</p>\r\n',	'3',	'assets/uploads/users/1137084142477951_9HrMmZFvbl3V9m4O4qYP_height640.png',	'2019-09-07 12:25:10',	'2019-09-07 12:25:10'),

The more traders in a particular options strike, the better the chances you&rsquo;ll have to get in and out of your trade without too much slippage.&nbsp; There are many different factors that go into option pricing and how it changes over time according to how the security moves.&nbsp; Delta tells you how much the option will move for every point the security moves.&nbsp; For example if the security move up one point the option would appreciate $0.48 on the 128 calls strike price.&nbsp; Gamma tells you how much the delta will change for every one point move of the security.&nbsp; For example when looking at the 128 calls if the security moves up one point gamma will change delta from $0.48 to $0.57.&nbsp; Theta is time decay so for everyday that passes the option will depreciate whatever amount theta states.&nbsp; All options depreciate regardless if it moves or not.&nbsp; The closer the option gets to expiration date the more it decays or depreciates.&nbsp; That&#39;s why the further out in time you purchase the option the more expensive it will be.&nbsp; For example when looking at the 128 calls everyday that passes the option will depreciate -$0.08.&nbsp; Vega tells us how much an option will change for every percentage move in implied volatility.&nbsp; For example if implied volatility goes up by one percent the 128 calls will increase $0.08.&nbsp; Learning to trade options takes time and practice.&nbsp; There are many different option strategies including spreads and straddles that we will go over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://carz91.com/tradeGame/assets/uploads/users/190_Credit_Spread.PNG\" style=\"height:403px; width:432px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many different option strategies to trade depending on what your analysis of the market is.&nbsp; We will go over the essential spreads and strategies to be profitable.&nbsp; We will discuss buying and selling single calls and puts toward the end of the course because it is the simplest and easiest to understand.&nbsp; The first option strategy we will discuss is the vertical spread.&nbsp; There are 2 types of vertical spreads credit spreads and debit spreads. Credit Spreads is selling one option strike price while buying another option strike price.&nbsp; If you&#39;re buying a call you need to be selling a call.&nbsp; If you&#39;re buying a put you should be selling a put to be a credit spread.&nbsp; You&#39;re not buying a call option strike and selling a put option strike.&nbsp; For example if you look at the image of the put option chain you can sell the 190 strike price and buy the 185 strike price.&nbsp; When you do that you will bring in a credit into your account.&nbsp; So if you get filled on the buy order of $2.50 and the sell order of $3.25 you will bring in $0.75 into your account.&nbsp; You generally want to place your orders halfway between the bid and ask price to get the best prices.&nbsp; As long as that stock don&#39;t close below 190 on expiration, which for this option is the third Friday of the month, you will keep the full amount you initially made of $0.75.&nbsp; If it starts to trade below the 190 price you want to close out the trade by buying back the 190 strike you initially sold and selling the 185 you initially bought.&nbsp; To trade a put credit spread you always have to sell the higher strike price and buy the lower strike price,&nbsp; To trade a call credit spread you always have to buy the higher strike price and sell the lower strike price.&nbsp; Lots of Practice!</p>\r\n',	'6',	'assets/uploads/users/1135132251738024_pqX7Pc2Gp1mVnfhvx6tB_height64012.png',	'2019-08-17 12:49:04',	'2019-08-17 12:49:04'),

As you engage the markets, you will discover things about yourself that may be surprising.&nbsp; One of the main keys of successful trading is identifying those tendencies, attitudes, and behaviors undermining your trading objectives. There is usually a gap between how we actually do things and how we think we do them. In order to make any changes, you need to measure this gap and then derive a plan to close it. This process begins with a realistic assessment of where your trading is right now.The least talked about thing in trading is the most important thing in trading and that is Psychology.&nbsp; Even though you may know when you want to enter and when you want to exit doing it under pressure is very difficult.&nbsp; The reason why there so much pressure is because you have to make split decisions, constantly with real money involved.&nbsp; The holy grail or most important skill a trader can possess is trading without emotion.&nbsp; In trading and life, some things work and others don&#39;t. Trading psychology is about taking inventory of both and making adjustments to improve not only your performance, but also to enhance your experience along the way. The primary objective of trading psychology is to help you stick to your plan. It is hard to reach your destination without it. It is said that &lsquo;luck is when opportunity meets preparation&rsquo;.

For example if you buy the 127 call strike and the 127 put strike you will pay about $3.59.

It is also just like the straddle used for times that you believe there will be significant volatility to come into the market. If you wanna protect yourself for volatility in both direction but give yourself more profit potential in one direction rather than the other you should be trading a strangle. For example if you buy the 128 call strike and buy the 125 put strike you will pay $2.43 which is less than the straddle but you have a better chance of making money if the stock moves up rather than down because of the higher delta. You will still give yourself profit potential on the downside though just not as much as the upside. The put that you buy will cost less than the call that you buy in this trade.
